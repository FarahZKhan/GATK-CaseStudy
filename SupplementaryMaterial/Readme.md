  # Supplementary material
This directory contains supplementary information including details about parameter customization and visual appearance of the three approaches to workflow definition i.e. Galaxy, Cpipe and CWL. 

1. Additional file 1 contains the customization of parameters to make the implementation similar across Cpipe and Galaxy. Note that as CWL workflow was built from scratch, the same paramter setting was used for that workflow as well. 
2. Additional file 2 depicts the visual difference of the implementation details with the help of diagrams of interface and specifications used in this case study.
