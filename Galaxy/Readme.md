  # Instructions to reproduce GATK variant calling workflow using Galaxy:
We have provided the complete galaxy workflow implemented in the case study using Galaxy pages which will allow researchers easily view, reproduce, or extend this analysis.

The complete Galaxy workflow along with the data used is provided at the following Galaxy page: 
http://115.146.88.195/galaxy/u/sehrish/p/gatk-variant-calling-workflow-with-chr21. User can import this page to their galaxy instance and execute the workflow. 

Alternatively, this directory also contains the workflow file named as 'Galaxy-Workflow-Variant_Calling_Workflow_Implementation.ga'. The same file is also available at https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_377/Paper-Data/WorkflowFiles/Galaxy-Workflow-Variant_Calling_Workflow_Implementation.ga. 

The final output of the workflow named as 'Galaxy-broad-filtered.recode.vcf' is provided for comparison of results.
